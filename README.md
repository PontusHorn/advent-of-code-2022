# advent-of-code-2022

Doing [AoC 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022/) as babby's first Rust and learning as I go! Putting limited time into it so I'm already running behind - but prioritising learning over completion.

## How to run

- [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started)
- Modify the `use days::*` statement in `src/main.rs` to point to the puzzle to run
- Add a file named `input.txt` containing the puzzle input in the project root directory
- Run `cargo run -- input.txt` in a terminal from the project root directory
